## Sample Blog

This is a sample project used to demonstrate how a simple blog would be written using Giraffe.

At present my focus is on the UI layer, so playing around with the Giraffe ViewEngine, so the data will be held in memory.

## Running the App

To run the app locally:

1. Go to root of project
2. Run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch` (assuming you have .NET installed)
3. Load [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) in your browser.
4. Have fun!
